CS81 Math Toolkit Reflections:

Working through these functions helped me understand how small pieces of logic can be broken down and reused. It was helpful to see how predictions matched (or didn’t match) the actual output. One thing I noticed is how important testing is—even simple functions can give unexpected results if you're not paying attention to edge cases. I also got more comfortable with the Git workflow by committing and pushing after each change. That part felt repetitive at first, but now I see how it keeps everything organized and easy to track. This kind of workflow will definitely help in bigger projects later on.
