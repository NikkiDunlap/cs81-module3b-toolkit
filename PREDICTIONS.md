double(n): I think the double(n) function will return the number multiplied by 2. 
If I pass in 5, it should return 10.

square(n): I think this will return the input number raised to the power of 2. So square(4) should return 16.

isEven(n): This function should return true if the number is even and false if itâ€™s not. For example, isEven(6) should return true.

isOdd(n): I expect this to return true only for odd numbers. So isOdd(7) should return true.

multiply(a, b): I think this will return the product of two numbers. So multiply(3, 4) should return 12.
